> *This package allows you to install VPN Client quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.*  
> *If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

Install a VPN connection on your self-hosted server.
* Useful for hosting your server behind a filtered (and/or non-neutral) internet access.
* Useful to have static IP addresses (IPv6 and IPv4).
* Useful to easily move your server anywhere.
* Strong firewalling (internet access and self-hosted services only available through the VPN, not leaking to your commercial ISP)
* Combine with the [Hotspot app](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/hotspot_ynh) to broadcast VPN-protected WiFi to other laptops without any further technical configuration needed.



**Shipped version:** 2.2~ynh4
